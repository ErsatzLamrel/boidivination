IMPORTANT: Do not move files out of the "Multiplayer Rooms" or "Single Player Rooms" folders. Copy and paste them where you need them. Also if you add/edit any rooms make sure they are saved to either the single player or multiplayer folder based on which they are. DO NOT only leave them saved in the main rooms folder or they might be overwritten and your progress will be lost. 


To activate either single player or multiplayer rooms COPY the files from either the single player or multiplayer folder to the main rooms folder and overwrite the files if needed. Please only copy one set (either single player or multiplayer) of rooms to the main folder at a time, not a mixture of both. There will be a ROOMTYPE.txt file to go with both folders. If you want to know which set of rooms is currently in the main folder read ROOMTYPE.txt in "rooms"


The rooms are sorted into folders
	-The main "rooms" folder is where active room .stb files go
	-"Single Player Rooms" is where the custom single player room files go
	-"Multiplayer Rooms" is where the custom Co-Op room files go
	-"Unchanged" holds the room files that I haven't changed yet for easy access when I need them
